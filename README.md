# Learning "Programming Language Name"

This repository is a roadmap to learn and understand a programming language.
This roadmap is highly inspired by ThePrimeagens roadmap for learning new languages.

The roadmap consists of 5 primary tasks in which should be completed for me to understand
and be profecient in building things with the given language.

 - Task 1: Get an overview of the how basics of the language works.
 - Task 2: Complete one year of advent of code with the language.
 - Task 3: Build a web socket server in form of a simple chat server / client.
 - Task 4: Build a simple interpreter for a made up langage.
 - Task 5: Build a full project with the language such as a webapplication, cli or a library.

Once all of the tasks has been completed i should have a pretty good understanding of how
the language feels, what it takes to build stuff using the language and what it might be
good or bad for building in.

## Task 1 - Get An Overview of how the basics of the language works

Task 1 in the roadmap is the gain the basic knowledge of how the language is written
here it might be a good idea to find a simple short course covering the basics. 

The main point of this step is to get an understanding of the following:

- Syntax
- Variable declarations
- Data structures
- Operators
- Control flow
- Classes is actual
- Methods / Functions

After this step I should be able to have a basic understanding of how to write a simple 
function / class & method with the language.

## Task 2 - Complete one year of advent of code with the language

In this part it is simply just to go through all 24 days of an advent of code year,
and try to solve them using the language.

This step might be tedious and hard, but the good part of it is that you get to use
a lot of different techniques and different ways of how to use the language.

And there is probably a lot of already made solutions to be found on the internet
so if i get stuck or if i just want to see how other people completed a challenge,
then there is a high chance of finding that by completing a google search.

## Task 3 - Build a web socket server in form of a simple chat server / client

This step is to build a web socket server and a client for the server. A good project
is to simply build a chat server/client.

The point of this is to actually build a project with a functional server. In this
project you will also learn async/await how the language actually handles asynchronous
actions.

## Task 4 - Build a simple interpreter for a made up language

This step is to build an interpreter for a madeup langage. The reason for this step is
to have some sort of unified language which is made up, then to build the interpreter
for the language, which will force you to dive a bit deeper into how an interpreted language
works while you are learning a new language. Another good benifit of this task is that
when you are working through this roadmap for the second time you wiil be able to draw
similarities and differences to other languages that you know and have learning through
building an intepreter for the same "made up" language.

</br>


## Task 5 - Build a full project with the language

The last step is to build a full project using the language. This could be to build a
Web Applicationk, Cli Application or some other kind of project. The point here is
that you should be forced to think about patterns project structures and architectures.
You should also think about having some sort of database integration with the project.

Another great benifit here is to start learning about some of the different libraries
which is commonly used with the language, such as a web server framework or an ORM.
